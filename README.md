# i3wm-ubuntu-installer
This repository holds a collection of scripts, easy to obtain and run, that make it easy to install the lastest versions of i3 on ubuntu, especially if you're stuck in TTY like me right now and can't easily copy and paste long commands from the i3 website.

## Use
Please run the following:

    wget http://www.noahpaladino.com/i3wm-ubuntu-installer/{SCRIPTNAME}.sh
    source {SCRIPTNAME}.sh
